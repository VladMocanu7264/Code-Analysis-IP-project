# Code-Analysis-IP-project
Created and developed with Burcă Alina.

This is the programme we developed as our final project for "Introducere în programare".

It recieves C/C++ code as input in a text format, creates a tree based on its repetitive structures, decision structures, etc. and then makes a Nassi-Schneidermann diagram based on it, using an old graphics library: <graphics.h> that only works in Code::Blocks 1.15 and under.

It can recognise a great amount of C/C++ keywords and was able to make such a diagram for its own code!
